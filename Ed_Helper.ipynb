My secondary focus is to learn about the distribution of authorized recycling collection types and which are the most common. I want to find out how much of what collection type licenses can be used to pick up different forms of waste such as Municipal Waste (MW) vs Construction Demolition Waste (CDW).

If we don't consider this special area, Africa has the most accumulated area burnt by wildfires. However, 48 regions have never experienced wildfires, with a burned area of 0, such as Marshall Islands, Norfolk Island, Maldives, and so on. We speculate that Africa is more prone to wildfires due to its arid climate and vast land, which leads to the most accumulated area burnt by wildfires. However, wildfires in areas such as Marshall Islands, Norfolk Island, and Maldives may be difficult to occur due to the humid climate and smaller land.</td>\n",
